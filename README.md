# KravTime - Professional Training Timer

A professional Krav Maga training timer app built with React. Features customizable rounds, work/rest intervals, audio cues, and mobile-optimized PWA design.

## 💡 Why KravTime?

After 10 years as a Krav Maga instructor, I got frustrated with all the existing boxing/training timers. They either had terrible UX, interrupted my music, or just didn't work reliably during intense training sessions. not to mention countless adds. So I built the ultimate training timer I always wanted - one that actually works the way fighters need it to.
